# gmp-api
Projects created for the gmp-api will now be only available for thebypasser team.

<strike>This repository is now deprecated, I updated the code to make it more compact and proper and fixed multiple errors that could have ocured. Please use the new repository for your projects!<br>
If you want to access the leaked proxy_cors_bypasser module go to https://github.com/gamesmodplus/proxy_cors_bypasser <br>
If you want to access the code for gmplinkvertisecors.herokuapp.com go to https://github.com/gamesmodplus/gmplinkvertisecors-api <br>

I have decided to leak the python code I created and used for my api. Feel free to use this code in your own projects, credits are greatly appreciated.

I will most likely release the CORS Proxy bypasser as a python class which you may then implement into your main python project.
