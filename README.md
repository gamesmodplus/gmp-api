# gmp-api
I am curently updating the repository please wait

<strike>I have decided to leak the python code I created and used for my api. Feel free to use this code in your own projects, credits are greatly appreciated.

I will most likely release the CORS Proxy bypasser as a python class which you may then implement into your main python project.
